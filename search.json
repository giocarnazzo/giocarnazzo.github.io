    "text": "The Kansas City Royals beat the Baltimore Orioles in the American League Wild Card Series in 2024. Which team would you rather be heading into 2025? The Royals swept Baltimore in the playoffs in October, but there is certainly a debate to be had.\nThe two teams began their rebuilds under similar circumstances in 2017. Following back to back World Series appearances, the Kansas City Royals looked poised to potentially compete for another in 2016 with much of their core players returning. However, the team wound up being bang average. Finishing the year a disappointing 81-81.\nThe O’s on the other hand won 89 games and got themselves a date with the Toronto Blue Jays in what was at the time still the Wild Card game. A heartbreaking loss in extras put them on the couch along with the 2015 champion Royals.\nBoth organizations decided to give it one more go in 2017 to some extent with aging stars in the last years of their contracts, but the writing was on the wall. Baseball Reference puts the numbers for every big league hitter together. The site also includes player and team stats dating all the way back to before the live ball era. We are going to look at some to gauge the trajectory of the Royals and Orioles rebuilds and make an attempt at comparing them.\nThe easiest way to do that is by first comparing the number of wins the two organizations had between 2017 and this most recent season.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nroyals_orioles &lt;- read.csv(\"data/orioles_royals.csv\")\n\nggplot(data = royals_orioles) +\n  geom_bar(aes(x = Year, y = W, fill = Tm), stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\", width = 0.5) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Their rebuilds followed a similar trajectory until 2020\",\n    subtitle = \"Once COVID hit, the &lt;span style = 'color:blue;'&gt;Royals&lt;/span&gt; tried speeding their's up while the &lt;span style = 'color:orange;'&gt;Orioles&lt;/span&gt; followed the path to prolonged success.\",\n    caption = \"Sources: Baseball Reference | By Gio Carnazzo\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Wins\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"orange\", \"blue\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s interesting is it almost looks like Kansas City underwent two separate rebuilds during this span. Before COVID there was a steady decline in the amount of wins they were able to earn each season. After, it was almost as though they thought they had something.\nThey did not. The 2021 season for the Royals should honestly be studied. It was such a baffling year. Out of the 36 players who saw the field for them that season only four remain in the organization. Four.\nMany of the players on that team wound up going other places opening up spots for a much needed youth movement that would finally take place in 2022 for KC. Although it was necessary it led to a decrease in overall wins. Once those players got adjusted and more came up to the bigs the Royals finally saw light at the end of the baseball purgatory tunnel. Let’s take a look at their run differential over the eight seasons it took them to finally make it back to the fall classic.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nroyals &lt;- read.csv(\"data/royals.csv\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data = royals,\n    aes(y = Year, x = RA, xend = R),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"red\",\n    colour_xend = \"green\") + \n  labs(\n    x = \"Run Differential\",\n    y = \"Year\", \n    title = \"Offensive progression throughout the Royals rebuild\",\n    subtitle = \"&lt;span style = 'color:blue;'&gt;Kansas City&lt;/span&gt; started winning as they fixed their pitching staff and began to score more runs.\",\n    caption = \"Sources: Baseball Reference | By Gio Carnazzo\") +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Royals only had one season where they scored more runs than they gave up and it was this past one. Baltimore clearly had a more efficient rebuild on the surface. They reached the playoffs before Kansas City ever got close and they managed to win more games than the Royals in each of the last three seasons.\nThey also did not just make the playoffs before their counterpart because that would be underselling it. While Royals fans were enduring one of the worst seasons in franchise history in 2023, Baltimore was in the midst of one of their best. Their 101 wins were the second most in all of baseball behind only the Atlanta Braves.\nWhat changed for them? They stopped giving up runs and they started scoring more of them. That much is obvious, but how wide was the margin? Let’s look at Baltimore’s run differential this time.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(gt)\n\norioles &lt;- read.csv(\"data/orioles.csv\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data = orioles,\n    aes(y = Year, x = RA, xend = R),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"red\",\n    colour_xend = \"green\") + \n  labs(\n    x = \"Run Differential\",\n    y = \"Year\", \n    title = \"Offensive progression throughout the Orioles rebuild\",\n    subtitle = \"&lt;span style = 'color:orange;'&gt;Baltimore&lt;/span&gt; started winning as they started scoring more runs and giving up less.\",\n    caption = \"Sources: Baseball Reference | By Gio Carnazzo\") +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike KC, they saw pretty steady progression throughout the rebuild. The Royals negative run margin pretty much stayed the chasm it was up following 2020 up until 2024, but the Orioles began to give up less and score more with every year that passed.\nThis showed a solid plan was in place and they took the steps they needed to go from one level to the next. So, how did the two teams take such different paths and somehow wind up in the same place in 2024?\nStar players in sports are the ultimate equalizer. Especially when they elevate the play of the athletes around them. Bobby Witt Jr. arrived in 2023, but his career took off in 2024. Gunnar Henderson’s did as well. The two superstars headlined a class of prospects for both teams that were developed by the organization during the early years of the rebuilds.\nThere are certainly guys like Cedric Mullins and Salvador Perez who stuck it out, but they are few and far between. In fact they are the only two position players that played on either team before COVID. The rest of the highlighted dots represent prospects from both teams that were developed before 2020 and promoted after.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nroyals_lineup_home &lt;- read.csv(\"data/royals_lineup_home.csv\")\norioles_lineup_home &lt;- read.csv(\"data/orioles_lineup_home.csv\")\nroyals_orioles_lineups &lt;- read.csv(\"data/royals_orioles_lineups.csv\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n  data = royals_orioles_lineups,\n  aes(x = WAR, y = PA),\n  color=\"lightgrey\"\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n  data = royals_lineup_home,\n  aes(x = WAR, y = PA),\n  color = \"blue\"\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n  data = orioles_lineup_home,\n  aes(x = WAR, y = PA),\n  color=\"orange\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n       x = \"WAR\",\n       y = \"Plate Appearances\", \n       title = \"Comparing the players currently on the rosters that joined during the rebuild\",\n       subtitle = \"The &lt;span style = 'color:blue;'&gt;Royals&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style = 'color:orange;'&gt;Orioles&lt;/span&gt; utilized the draft and international free agency to rebuild their lineups.\",\n       caption=\"Source: Baseball Reference | By Gio Carnazzo\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_line()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast bit!"

    "title": "Does Bobby Witt Jr. Deserve an MVP in 2024?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Bobby Witt Jr. had a historic season in 2024. He deserved to win an MVP and the numbers show it. The only player keeping him from being the betting favorite to win the award in the American League wore pinstripes and led the most popular team in baseball with ridiculous offensive numbers for the second time in three years.\nAaron Judge was a thorn in the side of just about every team in baseball this season. His production at the plate was eerily similar to what he managed to do in the 2022 season when he wound up breaking the New York Yankees franchise record for home runs in a single season. He certainly deserves the recognition he will no doubt receive on November 21, when the AL’s most valuable player is announced. However, the 32-year-old who helped get the Yankees franchise to its first World Series since they won it all in 2009 was not the only player deserving of the award.\nNo I am not referring to his teammate Juan Soto. Although he along with Judge had a stellar season, what if I told you there was a player in Kansas City, no not Patrick Mahomes, who also deserved to be in the conversation? Would you believe me? How about if I told you this player led the league in batting average, won the Silver Slugger and Gold Glove at the shortstop position and led his team to its first playoff appearance since 2015?\nBobby Witt Jr. became the face of the Kansas City Royals the moment he was drafted in the summer of 2019 with the second overall selection. He was the definition of a five tool prospect, and immediately had expectations heaped upon him. He worked his way up through the Royals farm system fairly quickly showcasing all of the talents that made him such an exciting prospect. It is rare a player exceeds such lofty projections, but Witt Jr. has done that so far leading the league in hits in just his third professional season.\nBaseball Reference produces numbers for so many of the game’s biggest stars, past, present and those on their way. We are going to use some of these numbers to look at the ways in which Witt Jr. stacked up against some of the top performers from this past season as well as some of the MVP winners from the past.\nThe first part of being productive as a hitter is finding a way to get on base, and nobody did so more often by way of the batted ball than Bobby Witt Jr. Another way that many around the sport measure success is by looking at something called WAR which stands for wins above replacment. It is a fancy term for measuring a players overall value to a team. We are going to try to answer the question of whether or not Witt Jr. had a year deserving of an MVP by first combining hits and WAR into a visualization that includes the top 15 MVP candidates measured by WAR and the number of hits they had last season.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nbobby_batting &lt;- read_csv(\"data/batting.csv\")\n\n  top_war &lt;- bobby_batting |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Rk &lt; 16\n  )\n\nbobby &lt;- top_war |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Player == \"Bobby Witt Jr.\"\n  )\n\njudge &lt;- top_war |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Player == \"Aaron Judge\"\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=top_war, aes(x=reorder(Player, H), weight=H), fill=\"lightgrey\") + \n  geom_bar(data=bobby, aes(x=reorder(Player, H), weight=H), fill=\"gold\") +\n  geom_bar(data=judge, aes(x=reorder(Player, H), weight=H), fill=\"navyblue\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Bobby Witt Jr. Led the MLB in Hits\",\n    subtitle = \"In 2024, &lt;span style = 'color:gold;'&gt;Witt Jr.&lt;/span&gt; outpaced MVP candidate &lt;span style = 'color:navy;'&gt;Aaron Judge&lt;/span&gt; by a decent margin in total hits.\",\n    caption = \"Sources: Baseball Reference | By Gio Carnazzo\",\n    x = \"MVP Candidates\",\n    y = \"Hits\",\n  ) + theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBobby Witt Jr. led baseball in hits and beat out the competition by a fairly wide margin. No one else amongst the 15 best players measured by WAR surpassed 200 hits. He had 211.\nJudge came in at fifth on that graphic, but I would be remiss if I did not mention he did not get the opportunities Witt Jr. did. Judge was intentionally walked at a high rate making strictly relying on hits to judge a player a problematic statistic.\nSo, let’s even the scales on this next visualization by looking at a strength of Aaron Judge, extra base hits. He is one of the most effective power hitters in the game so let’s take a look and see how Witt Jr. measured up in that aspect of the game.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nbobby_batting &lt;- read_csv(\"data/batting.csv\")\n\nbob &lt;- c(\"2B\" = 45, \"3B\" = 11, \"HR\" = 32, 7)\najudge &lt;- c(\"2B\" = 36, \"3B\" = 1, \"HR\" = 58)\n\nwaffle_bob &lt;- waffle(\n    bob, \n    rows = 6, \n    title = \"Bobby Witt Jr.\", \n    xlab = \"1 square = 1 hit\", \n    colors = c(\"blue\", \"grey\", \"gold\", \"white\")\n  )\n\nwaffle_ajudge &lt;-  waffle(\n    ajudge, \n    rows = 6, \n    title = \"Aaron Judge\", \n    xlab = \"1 square = 1 hit\",\n    colors = c(\"navy\", \"grey\", \"black\")\n  )\n\niron(\n  waffle(\n    bob, \n    rows = 6, \n    colors = c(\"blue\", \"grey\", \"gold\", \"white\")\n  ) +\n    labs(\n      x = \"1 square = 1 extra base hit\",\n      title = \"Witt Jr. Narrowly Outslugged by Judge\",\n      subtitle = \"It was close despite Judge nearly doubling Witt's home run total\",\n      caption = \"Source: Baseball Reference | Graphic by Gio Carnazzo\") +\n    theme(\n      plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n      axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n      axis.title.y = element_blank()\n    ),\n  waffle(\n    ajudge, \n    rows = 6, \n    colors = c(\"navy\", \"grey\", \"black\")\n  ) +\n    labs(\n      x = \"1 square = 1 extra base hit\",\n      caption = \"Source: Baseball Reference | Graphic by Gio Carnazzo\"\n    )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, Judge won this comparison due to his size and raw power. What may have been surprising was that Witt Jr. had significantly less home runs than Judge, but he nearly made up the gap with his advantage in doubles and triples.\nExtra base hits are highly valued when it comes to the MVP conversation because they often lead to more runs. So does this mean that Judge deserves the MVP and Witt Jr. does not because of the value he brings in this aspect? Not exactly.\nSometimes there are seasons in which two players perform so well it is difficult to decide who was better simply by comparing the two. In this case, how do we decide who deserves the award when both athletes did so much to help their teams in different ways? The good thing is we do not have to. Baseball Reference provides a way for us to look to the past and compare the two players numbers against previous seasons from players that actually won the award.\nThis scatterplot compares two numbers, WAR and batting average for every MVP winner since 1999 from both leagues. It also includes Bobby Witt Jr. and Aaron Judge’s 2024 season’s. This allows us to see whether or not they were deserving in their own ways without pitting the two against each other. The reality according to this visualization is they both deserved to win the award this season. At least if wins above replacement and batting average are any indication.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nbobby_mvp_data &lt;- read_csv(\"data/mvp.csv\")\n\nmvp_position &lt;- bobby_mvp_data |&gt;\n  filter(WAR &gt; 0 & BA &gt; 0.2)\n\nbob &lt;- mvp_position |&gt; filter(Name == \"Bobby Witt Jr.\")\n\naj &lt;- mvp_position |&gt; filter(Name == \"Aaron Judge\", Year == \"2024\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data = mvp_position, aes(x = WAR, y = BA), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data = bob, aes(x = WAR, y = BA), color=\"gold\") +\n  geom_point(data = aj, aes(x = WAR, y = BA), color=\"navy\") +\n  geom_smooth(data = mvp_position, aes(x = WAR, y = BA), method=\"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n       x = \"WAR\",\n       y = \"Batting Average\", \n       title = \"Comparing Witt Jr. and Judge to Every MVP since 1999\",\n       subtitle = \"&lt;span style = 'color:gold;'&gt;Witt Jr.&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style = 'color:navy;'&gt;Judge&lt;/span&gt; end up amongst the most productive MVP seasons in the last 25 years.\",\n       caption=\"Source: Baseball Reference | By Gio Carnazzo\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_line()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill they both receive the award? No. Not unless they somehow both tie for first place votes which I am almost certain is impossible. So what does this tell us? Sometimes in sports there are year’s that stand out from the majority. Last season in Major League Baseball was one of those year’s. There were two players who put up ridiculous numbers and led their team’s at a level deserving of the MVP award, and that is awesome for the sport."
