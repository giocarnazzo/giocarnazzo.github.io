    "section": "",
    "text": "Bobby Witt Jr. had a historic season in 2024. He deserved to win an MVP and the numbers show it. The only player keeping him from being the betting favorite to win the award in the American League wore pinstripes and led the most popular team in baseball with ridiculous offensive numbers for the second time in three years.\nAaron Judge was a thorn in the side of just about every team in baseball this season. His production at the plate was eerily similar to what he managed to do in the 2022 season when he wound up breaking the New York Yankees franchise record for home runs in a single season. He certainly deserves the recognition he will no doubt receive on November 21, when the AL’s most valuable player is announced. However, the 32-year-old who helped get the Yankees franchise to its first World Series since they won it all in 2009 was not the only player deserving of the award.\nNo I am not referring to his teammate Juan Soto. Although he along with Judge had a stellar season, what if I told you there was a player in Kansas City, no not Patrick Mahomes, who also deserved to be in the conversation? Would you believe me? How about if I told you this player led the league in batting average, won the Silver Slugger and Gold Glove at the shortstop position and led his team to its first playoff appearance since 2015?\nBobby Witt Jr. became the face of the Kansas City Royals the moment he was drafted in the summer of 2019 with the second overall selection. He was the definition of a five tool prospect, and immediately had expectations heaped upon him. He worked his way up through the Royals farm system fairly quickly showcasing all of the talents that made him such an exciting prospect. It is rare a player exceeds such lofty projections, but Witt Jr. has done that so far leading the league in hits in just his third professional season.\nBaseball Reference produces numbers for so many of the game’s biggest stars, past, present and those on their way. We are going to use some of these numbers to look at the ways in which Witt Jr. stacked up against some of the top performers from this past season as well as some of the MVP winners from the past.\nThe first part of being productive as a hitter is finding a way to get on base, and nobody did so more often by way of the batted ball than Bobby Witt Jr. Another way that many around the sport measure success is by looking at something called WAR which stands for wins above replacment. It is a fancy term for measuring a players overall value to a team. We are going to try to answer the question of whether or not Witt Jr. had a year deserving of an MVP by first combining hits and WAR into a visualization that includes the top 15 MVP candidates measured by WAR and the number of hits they had last season.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nbobby_batting &lt;- read_csv(\"data/batting.csv\")\n\n  top_war &lt;- bobby_batting |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Rk &lt; 16\n  )\n\nbobby &lt;- top_war |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Player == \"Bobby Witt Jr.\"\n  )\n\njudge &lt;- top_war |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Player == \"Aaron Judge\"\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=top_war, aes(x=reorder(Player, H), weight=H), fill=\"lightgrey\") + \n  geom_bar(data=bobby, aes(x=reorder(Player, H), weight=H), fill=\"gold\") +\n  geom_bar(data=judge, aes(x=reorder(Player, H), weight=H), fill=\"navyblue\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Bobby Witt Jr. Led the MLB in Hits\",\n    subtitle = \"In 2024, &lt;span style = 'color:gold;'&gt;Witt Jr.&lt;/span&gt; outpaced MVP candidate Aaron &lt;span style = 'color:navy;'&gt;Judge&lt;/span&gt; by a decent margin in total hits.\",\n    caption = \"Sources: Baseball Reference | By Gio Carnazzo\",\n    x = \"MVP Candidates\",\n    y = \"Hits\",\n  ) + theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBobby Witt Jr. led baseball in hits and beat out the competition by a fairly wide margin. No one else amongst the 15 best players measured by WAR surpassed 200 hits. He had 211.\nJudge came in at fifth on that graphic, but I would be remiss if I did not mention he did not get the opportunities Witt Jr. did. Judge was intentionally walked at a high rate making strictly relying on hits to judge a player a problematic statistic.\nSo, let’s even the scales on this next visualization by looking at a strength of Aaron Judge, extra base hits. He is one of the most effective power hitters in the game so let’s take a look and see how Witt Jr. measured up in that aspect of the game.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nbobby_batting &lt;- read_csv(\"data/batting.csv\")\n\nbob &lt;- c(\"2B\" = 45, \"3B\" = 11, \"HR\" = 32, 7)\najudge &lt;- c(\"2B\" = 36, \"3B\" = 1, \"HR\" = 58)\n\nwaffle_bob &lt;- waffle(\n    bob, \n    rows = 6, \n    title = \"Bobby Witt Jr.\", \n    xlab = \"1 square = 1 hit\", \n    colors = c(\"blue\", \"grey\", \"gold\", \"white\")\n  )\n\nwaffle_ajudge &lt;-  waffle(\n    ajudge, \n    rows = 6, \n    title = \"Aaron Judge\", \n    xlab = \"1 square = 1 hit\", \n    colors = c(\"navy\", \"grey\", \"black\")\n  )\n\niron(\n  waffle(\n    bob, \n    rows = 6, \n    title = \"Witt Jr. vs. Judge\", \n    xlab = \"1 square = 1 hit\",\n    colors = c(\"blue\", \"grey\", \"gold\", \"white\")\n  ),\n  waffle(\n    ajudge, \n    rows = 6, \n    xlab = \"1 square = 1 hit\",\n    colors = c(\"navy\", \"grey\", \"black\")\n  ))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, Judge won this comparison due to his size and raw power. What may have been surprising was that Witt Jr. had significantly less home runs than Judge, but he nearly made up the gap with his advantage in doubles and triples.\nExtra base hits are highly valued when it comes to the MVP conversation because they often lead to more runs. So does this mean that Judge deserves the MVP and Witt Jr. does not because of the value he brings in this aspect? Not exactly.\nSometimes there are seasons in which two players perform so well it is difficult to decide who was better simply by comparing the two. In this case, how do we decide who deserves the award when both athletes did so much to help their teams in different ways? The good thing is we do not have to. Baseball Reference provides a way for us to look to the past and compare the two players numbers against previous seasons from players that actually won the award.\nThis scatterplot compares two numbers we have already become accustomed to, WAR and batting average for every MVP winner since 1999 from both leagues. It also includes Bobby Witt Jr. and Aaron Judge’s 2024 season’s.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nbobby_mvp_data &lt;- read_csv(\"data/mvp.csv\")\n\nmvp_position &lt;- bobby_mvp_data |&gt;\n  filter(WAR &gt; 0 & BA &gt; 0.2)\n\nbob &lt;- mvp_position |&gt; filter(Name == \"Bobby Witt Jr.\")\n\naj &lt;- mvp_position |&gt; filter(Name == \"Aaron Judge\", Year == \"2024\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data = mvp_position, aes(x = WAR, y = BA), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data = bob, aes(x = WAR, y = BA), color=\"gold\") +\n  geom_point(data = aj, aes(x = WAR, y = BA), color=\"navy\") +\n  geom_smooth(data = mvp_position, aes(x = WAR, y = BA), method=\"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n       x = \"WAR\",\n       y = \"Batting Average\", \n       title = \"Comparing Witt Jr. and Judge to Every MVP since 1999\",\n       subtitle = \"&lt;span style = 'color:gold;'&gt;Witt Jr.&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style = 'color:navy;'&gt;Judge&lt;/span&gt; end up amongst the most productive MVP seasons in the last 25 years.\",\n       caption=\"Source: Baseball Reference | By Gio Carnazzo\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_line()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is my last plot."
